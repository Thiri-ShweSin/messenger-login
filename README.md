# Messenger Login Page Clone

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this clone page which is almost exactly the same as the official messenger website landing page. This is not a phishing site and you don't have to worry about the input data as the form will not carry the data at all. I also make this page pretty responsive to all devices. So, make sure to check this out!
